# Arithmetic Operators
# print(1 + 1)
# print( 4 * 5)
# print(5 ** 2)
# print( 20 / 5)
# print(20 / 6)
# print(20 % 6)

# Arithmetic Operators with Strings
# print('string 1 ' + 'string 2')
# print('string 1 ' * 4) # You can multiply strings by numbers, but you cannot add a string to a number
# # Returns type error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
# print(' 1' + 4)

# Comparison, Logical and Membership Operators
# Comparison Operators
# print(True == True) # double equal signs is the comparison operator
# print( 4 < 5)
# print( 5 <= 5)
# print(5 > 2)
# print(5 >= 2)

# Logical Operators (and, or, not)
# Python uses English words for logical operators. 
# Unlike Java where you use '&&' for and, '||' for or, '!=' for not equal to 
# print(True and True) # both sides has to be True for 'and'
# print(True or False) # Only one side has to be True for 'or'
# print(not True) # 'not' only operators on one thing at a time and simply flips the Boolean and that it's operating on. 

# Membership Operators 'in' 'not in'
print( 1 in [1, 2, 3, 4 , 5])
print(10 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(10 not in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print( 'cat' in 'my pet cat')
print( 'cat' not in 'my pet cat')
